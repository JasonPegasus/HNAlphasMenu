# HNAlphasMenu (Or Hello Neighbor Alphas Mod Menu)

Small tool for modifying RAM values in hello neighbor Alphas, allowing the player to do cursed stuff.

Currently it supports only Alpha 1 but i plan to extend it to Pre-Alpha and *maybe* some fangames as from alpha 2 to forward you can use console.

<h2>Features:</h2>
As for now (Version 0.5.8) we have the following changes to the game separated in "Cheaties" (Direct player adventage) and "Features" (Cool additive stuff)
<ul>
  <h3>[ Cheaties ]</h3><br>
  <li>Fly/Noclip: Pretty self explainatory. Can use alternative mode (Disables physics completely).</li>
  <li>Freeze Neighbor: Self explainatory too. Can select the freezing position INCLUDING being drag by the player camera!</li>
  <li>Speed: Change the player's walk and run speed individually.</li>
  <li>FOV: Allow changing the Field of View of the player. Default is 112 (after intro cinematic), but originally alpha 1 desired one was 90.</li><br>
  <li>Push Neighbor: Pushes neighbor away once he gets to a certain distance to prevent him from catching the player. Be aware that the program doesn't match the game's FPS so if you run towards the neighbor you may get catch.</li>
  <li>Tp to Neighbor: Teleports the player constantly to neighbor's location, just for farming deaths lol.</li>
  <h3>[ Features ]</h3><br>
  <li>Ambience: Closeness ambience like new HN versions. Camera shake, darkening and lower fov when neighbor is near but in old alphas style. Neon is just a small setting for it to look more "neon like".</li>
  <li>Dynamic Fov: Fov changes depending on speed </li>
  <li>View Bobbing: *Cancelled feature due to camera angles not working as intended.*</li>
  <li>No Rotations: Disables engine physic's rotations completely.</li>
</ul>


You can also use the [old deprecated version](https://github.com/JasonPegasus/HNAlpha1Menu).
